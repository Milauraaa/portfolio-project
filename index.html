                Hello! Let's get to know each other!
                <br />
                My name is Mila. I have been working in the best restaurants in
                Vinnytsia and Odesa since I was 17. Starting as a waiter, in a
                few years I became a professional manager for a team of 50 to 90
                people. I always felt I had a tendency towards IT, so even when
                I was working as a manager, I took responsibility for all
                digital issues. I like to simplify complex things, find simple
                solutions and bring creativity and unusualness to work. I'm a
                little crazy, but I consider it as my advantage, because I know
                how to evaluate situations from different angles. The war
                changed all of my priorities and I had to leave my native home,
                work, goals, dreams. Now I have to start all over again. Because
                of this difficult step, I found coding for myself and discovered
                new sides of myself in website development. Probably, for the
                first time in my life, I feel one hundred percent sure that it
                is mine. I want to improve and write such codes that will take
                the breath away from the most demanding project customers!
                <br />
